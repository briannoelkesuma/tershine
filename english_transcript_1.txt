0.0: Jingelongan and welcome to perhaps one of the most requested videos.
28.0: We're going to make a whole car with all the products in it actually, so it's going to be crazy fun.
33.0: We have Mangan who works with us, his Honda CRV which he hasn't washed in a year and a half.
40.0: So this is really going to be something to bite into.
42.0: The funny thing about this one is it has a K24 in it, you know we love the Honda K engines.
47.0: But the car itself is probably not very exciting.
50.0: So that you will be able to come along when we run everything from scratch.
53.0: That is to say, we carry out all degreasing, trap cleaning, shampoo, refract, we come to windows, the plastic, everything.
61.0: So there really isn't much more that I'm going to talk about here before.
64.0: But we're starting right now at the beginning with getting started with the rims.
69.0: We always start with rims.
72.0: And I think you should have that in your washing routine.
74.0: Remember to start with the places where it is dirtiest.
78.0: For rims and such, imagine if you have washed the whole car and then you finish with rims.
82.0: It will splash up a lot of crap and stuff like that on the car.
85.0: Try to start with the dirtiest places first.
89.0: We will start with the entire rims.
91.0: What we will need then is of course the relief, i.e. our trap cleaning.
95.0: It is primarily for solving aviation rust and slightly tougher stuff.
100.0: Then we also run Dissolve, which is cold degreasing.
103.0: It solves petroleum-based dirt, i.e. asphalt splashes, bitumen and things like that.
107.0: And then also the extracts that dissolve all organic dirt.
111.0: So it will be a real fucking smoking combo with pulling on everything.
115.0: We will start by running Dissolve.
117.0: Then we run on the relief and then the extracts on top.
120.0: Now these are very dirty rims so we will drive with a brush and also a brush.
126.0: It may be that if it is this ingrained that you may need to do double turns.
131.0: We'll drag it on and let it sit for a while.
133.0: We also mix in pump bottles as we are going to make the whole car.
136.0: That way it goes so damn much faster.
138.0: So we run the relief in bottles and the rest we mix.
141.0: And then we pull on it and then we feed on.
143.0: This is quite self-playing so you will see in future clips when we work on the rims.
148.0: And hopefully they will be fantastic.
150.0: So rims first.
166.0: Then we showered on all the chemicals and let it sit for quite a while.
187.0: Of course, you know how it is with chemistry and what kind of rims it is.
191.0: Had this been a pair of pig-snout carbon fiber rims or some nicest walk-away rim.
196.0: Then you might not have started with brushes.
199.0: Then you might have rinsed it off and then analyzed whether you need to go even harder.
203.0: But with the fact that this is a rather screwy car so.
206.0: No offense to the manga, but it hasn't been washed in a long time.
210.0: So we go on the heavy guard at once.
212.0: And as you can see, Jomte runs with our Detailing Brushes.
215.0: These are sold in three packs in slightly different sizes.
218.0: And they're chemical resistant and stuff.
220.0: Actually, it's just a matter of starting to brush the rim and get everything that's sitting in here off.
226.0: We don't have acid-based things.
229.0: Sometimes you come across a rim where you kind of need acid.
233.0: Then you have to turn to someone else and buy such things.
236.0: But we want gadgets that are as kind and easy to use as possible.
240.0: Water Relief is usually enough.
242.0: Especially in combination with the dissolve and the extracts that dissolve everything.
246.0: So it's really just to brush on.
249.0: Then you run with the brush. Now the rims are quite small so it is difficult to access.
252.0: So we run brushes and really make sure we get off the deck.
257.0: And then we'll just rinse everything off.
260.0: Of course, we have also, as you have seen, run up the chemical up in the wheelhouses.
263.0: To get things sorted out there.
265.0: So me and Jomte put all the rims on the car in order and rinse off.
269.0: And then it will look fantastic afterwards.
276.0: Subtitles Stina Hedin www.btistudios.com
306.0: Then the rims are ready and, as you saw, super simple.
317.0: And as I always say, think ahead.
319.0: What kind of rim are you going to attack?
321.0: Now it's the paint we're going to use with the chemical itself.
325.0: And it will be exactly the same procedure really.
327.0: So we start with the dissolve, i.e. the cold degreasing.
330.0: Then we run the extracts and also the relief in the same turn.
334.0: Now it depends a little on what kind of car you have.
337.0: I completely agree that you can run cold degreasing first, rinse clean.
340.0: Then you run the flight rust-free, i.e. relief.
343.0: To remove all the little crap stuck in the paint.
346.0: Rinse off and then apply extract.
348.0: But I think all three of these work pretty well together.
352.0: And that is usually enough.
354.0: So it becomes the dissolve, the relief on top of the dissolve.
358.0: And then there will be extract on top of that.
360.0: In total, we might let this go on for 10-15 minutes.
363.0: Remember it's cold outside.
365.0: Then it may have to be up to 20-25 minutes.
367.0: Is it a bit warmer, as long as it doesn't dry out.
370.0: And if necessary, you may have to redo it if there are really big, thick asphalt cracks and stuff like that.
376.0: But now we pull the chemical, let it drag.
378.0: Then it will be rinsed off and the next step after that will of course be champagne.
408.0: Of course, we also run chemicals in the entire doorways now.
412.0: When it's like this, now it's really dirty.
415.0: Then we run, we run dissolve, extract and relieven here in the doorways as well.
419.0: Then it is important to use the dissolven, which is a cold degreaser that dissolves grease and stuff like that.
425.0: That you make sure to lubricate some hinges and stuff like that too.
428.0: We shower on and let it last just as long as on the outside.
431.0: Even in the doorways to be able to rinse it clean.
434.0: We drive along doors and such as well.
436.0: Then we have chemed the whole car and let it run for about a quarter of an hour.
440.0: So now we're going to start washing the car.
442.0: Then it's as if you always start by flushing from the bottom up.
446.0: The theory behind it is that the dirt should not stick.
450.0: Honestly, it makes such a difference. Choose yourself.
454.0: It's like everything with car care.
456.0: Do the same thing all the time so you know you're not missing anything.
461.0: So now it's just a matter of flushing properly from the bottom up.
465.0: Do it very carefully because you will be happier for it later.
468.0: Because you get rid of stones and small things that can later get stuck in the washing glove.
472.0: Rinse and then the next step is to wash the car with shampoo.
502.0: Then it's time for the shampoo moment. We have chosen Purify S.
514.0: It is our big seller and fantastic shampoo.
517.0: As you know, the leaver gives an absolutely awesome shine afterwards.
520.0: We will also run a little with the Foam Gun. It's the Purify S in the Foam Gun.
524.0: There is a neat video for that. I'll link it below so you can see how to mix.
529.0: I think it's quite nice to foam out the Purify S first so that you get it all over the car.
534.0: You do this out of opportunity, of course.
536.0: Then we run a bit in the bucket as usual and fluff it up.
539.0: Then Jomte and I will drive with wash gloves.
542.0: Of course, it works well with a sponge or if you use microfiber cloths.
546.0: But just think about drawing straight lines which I always nag about.
549.0: So that you minimize the risk if something gets in.
552.0: We will foam this out and then shampoo the whole car.
555.0: So we drive on.
589.0: It's great to get a good lubricating surface.
591.0: Now it is important that you start from the top down.
594.0: Now there are several of us who do this.
596.0: But start from the top down. Straight lines so you don't get these washing suns.
601.0: When the sun hits the paint when it's dry, it's much nicer.
605.0: If you have drawn straight lines, there is less risk of seeing such things.
608.0: And as I said, start from the top and work your way down.
611.0: You know I've talked about it in several videos when I show how to wash otherwise.
615.0: I never go further than down to this edge which is usually the case.
618.0: If you have a car that doesn't have a slightly more modern edge, you have to be a little sensitive.
623.0: But pull down to the edge and then you take the last turn.
629.0: Then you also know that I usually talk about the two-bucket method.
632.0: It is also just like everything else before.
634.0: Is this a Ferrari or something else?
636.0: Or like your little dream car?
640.0: Then the two-bucket method runs.
643.0: It is always nice to minimize the risk and have some problems.
646.0: But since we know the basic condition of this one, it is a bucket that will do just fine.
651.0: Because we have thoroughly tested it before.
654.0: And I think most of you out there will drive a bucket anyway.
657.0: But yes, Purify S.
659.0: Now we shampoo the whole car and then it's not that much more that we have to rinse it off.
662.0: And so the next step is to dry the car.
676.0: And while Mangan and Jomte are shampooing the car, I'll take care of the rims.
680.0: After all, we've already done rough work and it's usually enough like this.
683.0: But I like to... Of course, you have to separate the bucket for your rim stuff.
688.0: It must absolutely be its own bucket.
690.0: But I usually only use ordinary microfiber cloths.
693.0: Then you can drive a cheap variant. It doesn't have to be anything special.
696.0: But I run our usual standard canvas.
698.0: So I think it's shit nice to really be able to access and get into the back of the rim.
703.0: Where it is difficult to access with brushes and things like this.
706.0: So, like driving with a microfibre cloth usually works really well.
709.0: It's gentle, it's easy to access.
712.0: And yes, it's not that much harder than that.
714.0: So I drive all the rims and then they get to keep shampooing.
717.0: And then we just have to rinse them off.
721.0: And then you know with the water that is left in the bucket.
723.0: There are damn expensive drops in here.
725.0: I'm a little crazy.
726.0: I usually finish with the water that is left in the regular shampoo bucket.
730.0: I finish that by just kind of throwing a little light on the rims.
733.0: It's usually enough, there's usually a little bit left.
736.0: And that's enough, as are all four rims.
738.0: Probably makes no difference, but it feels nice.
740.0: And man, no drops go to waste.
760.0: Then we have reached the point where it is actually time to start drying the car.
764.0: But you know that we have Refracten, which is absolutely amazing as a wet coat.
769.0: And I know there are a lot of you out there who may not really have a clue what wet coat is.
773.0: We've done some films and stuff like this.
775.0: We have here, this is our Refracten ceramic quick coat, I call it.
780.0: It works equally well on a wet or dry car.
782.0: We have a variant that is with an apology.
785.0: And you know that it will work out.
787.0: So it is only important that you shake it beforehand.
789.0: So this one is one in ten.
790.0: And then we also have it in its pure form as well.
793.0: So we thought we'd show the car here now, how it works and how damn nice it is.
797.0: Because as you can see, there is basically zero runoff here.
800.0: So either way, I'll show both with the excused one and the regular one.
804.0: And you won't notice a huge difference.
807.0: Drive when it's clean and it will last better.
809.0: And productivity, that's a big difference.
812.0: Drive when it's clean and it will last better.
814.0: And the product is absolutely best applied to a completely dry car.
818.0: But, we shower a little.
820.0: We can start with the one who is one in ten then.
822.0: Just shake it well before.
824.0: And then just start showering.
826.0: Then you don't have to take such absolutely magnificent amounts.
829.0: But make sure that you really cover the surfaces that are to be showered off as well.
837.0: We'll make sure we don't miss anything here.
839.0: And as I said, this is diluted one in ten.
841.0: We just shower.
843.0: And then you start from the top down.
872.0: Yes, as you can see, there will be a lot of runoff all at once.
876.0: It is important, however, that you have to dry the car afterwards.
880.0: Because there is a risk that it could become a little bit flamboyant if it just dries in like this.
884.0: So if you just wipe the car afterwards, it will be amazing.
887.0: And as I said, that was one in ten.
889.0: Now we will drive down the concentrate rest of the part up here.
892.0: And it will last a little better.
894.0: But that's quite a lot of product waste.
896.0: Because it takes quite a lot.
897.0: So always start by diluting it.
899.0: And then also, if you have high blood pressure.
901.0: A little depending on how high the pressure is.
903.0: Try to shoot at an oblique angle all the time.
905.0: With the fact that it is a little jelly-like in shape.
908.0: So it will be easier to get it off instead of just shooting straight.
912.0: But here we run it completely in pure format.
915.0: This is like a black car.
917.0: So this is quite difficult to achieve with many products.
922.0: But because the refract is so damn easy to use.
925.0: So, yes.
929.0: So.
955.0: And here you can see this quite clearly.
957.0: As I nag about it becoming a bit jellyish.
959.0: Here we have washed it off.
961.0: And here it remains.
962.0: And as you see.
963.0: It will be like a slightly soapy film.
966.0: So it is therefore important that you rinse it off properly.
969.0: And then you dry.
970.0: Then there won't be any problems.
972.0: But let yourselves when this.
973.0: Do you see the batter?
974.0: Dry in the sun.
975.0: Of course, then it gets a little flamboyant.
977.0: But just make sure you rinse it off properly.
979.0: So it will be all thumbs up.
987.0: So.
1003.0: Then we have run the refract as a wet coat this time.
1006.0: And it's probably a little, so most people use it.
1009.0: But again.
1010.0: I think it's cruelest on a dry car.
1012.0: Here it was a little because we wanted to show.
1014.0: A black car is damn nice to see the difference too.
1016.0: Now it's time to wipe the car.
1018.0: And here I am with the Apex Plus.
1020.0: And you know that I'm always nagging about.
1022.0: I think it's great to use as a drying support.
1024.0: Now maybe it will be a little cake on top of the cake.
1027.0: Actually when you have run the refract as a wet coat.
1030.0: But still a little nice to just draw some shower in the canvas.
1034.0: Because then you kind of help.
1035.0: If it should be the case that there is a slightly thicker layer of refract left.
1039.0: Or something like that.
1040.0: You get a little lubricating surface.
1042.0: And yes, it's just a matter of starting to dry.
1044.0: Don't forget that you should otherwise always run Apex Plus as a drying aid.
1048.0: It helps the surface become much crisper and fresher.
1051.0: So yeah, it's not much more than that.
1053.0: We dry the car and then we are almost done on the outside.
1075.0: Then we are done with all the chemicals on the outside.
1078.0: And the result is at least 100% nicer.
1082.0: But then the car is super scratchy.
1084.0: You can't do anything about that.
1085.0: We have to polish that off, of course.
1087.0: Now it's more for us to show all the products and such.
1090.0: But now all the little details remain.
1092.0: We'll keep at it and fix a bit with the windows.
1094.0: We will do the plastic stuff on the outside.
1096.0: A little tire lance and all that.
1098.0: So now we back it in to us.
1100.0: Then it's time for the squares.
1102.0: In the meantime, Mangan and Jonte will start cleaning out the car.
1106.0: We start by taking it off because we can see that it is littered.
1109.0: Make sure it is sufficiently chilled.
1111.0: Then we can hold on and take it off.
1113.0: That's the last thing I have taxes on.
1115.0: And so it's not that long before you've taken the car off
1117.0: to make sure it's completely frozen.
1119.0: And then I get to take it off.
1120.0: It is crunchy that you feel that it is so unused.
1122.0: It's like you shouldn't do business with it.
1124.0: It is much more disruptive.
1126.0: It's time for the windows and in the meantime manga and jonte will start cleaning the car, start vacuuming and something like that.
1132.0: Here I stand with two different cloths. I run regular Vision then, the one without drainage.
1136.0: There is, of course, Vision Plus, which also has a slightly easier drainage.
1139.0: Two different cloths, the glass cloth that penetrates a little more deeply and then I will dry with the all-round cloth.
1147.0: And it's really not more difficult than just a little shower in the cloth, dry, be a little careful and then dry clean.
1152.0: There are product videos that are specific to each product. I'm much more nerdy about all aspects.
1158.0: The whole point of this video is that we're just going to show how you can take another crappy car and make it damn fresh in like an hour, an hour and a half.
1165.0: So I get started.
1267.0: Then we're finally done and yes, as you've seen, it's here, it's really easy.
1272.0: We have actually used the entire range that we have with everything from degreasers, shampoo, refract.
1279.0: We also snuck in some Apex Plus, we've done the inside with APC.
1283.0: We have used all variations on canvases, brushes, everything like that.
1287.0: What could it have taken? Maybe two hours something like that. A really good rough wash on the car.
1293.0: The result speaks for itself. It looks super fresh.
1297.0: Scratches and stuff like that we can't do anything about, dents and other stuff.
1301.0: Then you have to come up with a polishing machine and some other tools.
1303.0: But as you can see, it's really super, super easy to get to the car really, really well at home.
1309.0: And yes, I hope you enjoyed it. Give a thumbs up, don't forget to comment, share and all that stuff.
1315.0: And you can also press the subscribe button so you don't miss the next video.
1319.0: But yes, this was just a small, though not so simple video.
1323.0: But a video where we clean the entire car with the entire range.
1327.0: So I hope you thought it was fun, see you next time, then go crazy!
