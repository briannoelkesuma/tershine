{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Jingelongan and welcome to perhaps one of the most requested videos."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "We're going to make a whole car with all the products in it actually, so it's going to be crazy fun."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "We have Mangan who works with us, his Honda CRV which he hasn't washed in a year and a half."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "So this is really going to be something to bite into."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "The funny thing about this one is it has a K24 in it, you know we love the Honda K engines."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "But the car itself is probably not very exciting."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "So that you will be able to come along when we run everything from scratch."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "That is to say, we carry out all degreasing, trap cleaning, shampoo, refract, we come to windows, the plastic, everything."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "So there really isn't much more that I'm going to talk about here before."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "But we're starting right now at the beginning with getting started with the rims."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "We always start with rims."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And I think you should have that in your washing routine."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Remember to start with the places where it is dirtiest."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "For rims and such, imagine if you have washed the whole car and then you finish with rims."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "It will splash up a lot of crap and stuff like that on the car."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Try to start with the dirtiest places first."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "We will start with the entire rims."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "What we will need then is of course the relief, i.e. our trap cleaning."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "It is primarily for solving aviation rust and slightly tougher stuff."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Then we also run Dissolve, which is cold degreasing."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "It solves petroleum-based dirt, i.e. asphalt splashes, bitumen and things like that."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And then also the extracts that dissolve all organic dirt."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "So it will be a real fucking smoking combo with pulling on everything."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "We will start by running Dissolve."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Then we run on the relief and then the extracts on top."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Now these are very dirty rims so we will drive with a brush and also a brush."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "It may be that if it is this ingrained that you may need to do double turns."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "We'll drag it on and let it sit for a while."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "We also mix in pump bottles as we are going to make the whole car."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "That way it goes so damn much faster."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "So we run the relief in bottles and the rest we mix."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And then we pull on it and then we feed on."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "This is quite self-playing so you will see in future clips when we work on the rims."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And hopefully they will be fantastic."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "So rims first."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Then we showered on all the chemicals and let it sit for quite a while."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Of course, you know how it is with chemistry and what kind of rims it is."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Had this been a pair of pig-snout carbon fiber rims or some nicest walk-away rim."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Then you might not have started with brushes."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Then you might have rinsed it off and then analyzed whether you need to go even harder."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "But with the fact that this is a rather screwy car so."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "No offense to the manga, but it hasn't been washed in a long time."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "So we go on the heavy guard at once."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And as you can see, Jomte runs with our Detailing Brushes."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "These are sold in three packs in slightly different sizes."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And they're chemical resistant and stuff."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Actually, it's just a matter of starting to brush the rim and get everything that's sitting in here off."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "We don't have acid-based things."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Sometimes you come across a rim where you kind of need acid."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Then you have to turn to someone else and buy such things."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "But we want gadgets that are as kind and easy to use as possible."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Water Relief is usually enough."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Especially in combination with the dissolve and the extracts that dissolve everything."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "So it's really just to brush on."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Then you run with the brush. Now the rims are quite small so it is difficult to access."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "So we run brushes and really make sure we get off the deck."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And then we'll just rinse everything off."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Of course, we have also, as you have seen, run up the chemical up in the wheelhouses."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "To get things sorted out there."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "So me and Jomte put all the rims on the car in order and rinse off."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And then it will look fantastic afterwards."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Subtitles Stina Hedin www.btistudios.com"}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Then the rims are ready and, as you saw, super simple."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And as I always say, think ahead."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "What kind of rim are you going to attack?"}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Now it's the paint we're going to use with the chemical itself."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And it will be exactly the same procedure really."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "So we start with the dissolve, i.e. the cold degreasing."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Then we run the extracts and also the relief in the same turn."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Now it depends a little on what kind of car you have."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "I completely agree that you can run cold degreasing first, rinse clean."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Then you run the flight rust-free, i.e. relief."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "To remove all the little crap stuck in the paint."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Rinse off and then apply extract."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "But I think all three of these work pretty well together."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And that is usually enough."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "So it becomes the dissolve, the relief on top of the dissolve."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And then there will be extract on top of that."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "In total, we might let this go on for 10-15 minutes."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Remember it's cold outside."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Then it may have to be up to 20-25 minutes."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Is it a bit warmer, as long as it doesn't dry out."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And if necessary, you may have to redo it if there are really big, thick asphalt cracks and stuff like that."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "But now we pull the chemical, let it drag."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Then it will be rinsed off and the next step after that will of course be champagne."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Of course, we also run chemicals in the entire doorways now."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "When it's like this, now it's really dirty."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Then we run, we run dissolve, extract and relieven here in the doorways as well."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Then it is important to use the dissolven, which is a cold degreaser that dissolves grease and stuff like that."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "That you make sure to lubricate some hinges and stuff like that too."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "We shower on and let it last just as long as on the outside."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Even in the doorways to be able to rinse it clean."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "We drive along doors and such as well."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Then we have chemed the whole car and let it run for about a quarter of an hour."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "So now we're going to start washing the car."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Then it's as if you always start by flushing from the bottom up."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "The theory behind it is that the dirt should not stick."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Honestly, it makes such a difference. Choose yourself."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "It's like everything with car care."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Do the same thing all the time so you know you're not missing anything."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "So now it's just a matter of flushing properly from the bottom up."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Do it very carefully because you will be happier for it later."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Because you get rid of stones and small things that can later get stuck in the washing glove."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Rinse and then the next step is to wash the car with shampoo."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Then it's time for the shampoo moment. We have chosen Purify S."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "It is our big seller and fantastic shampoo."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "As you know, the leaver gives an absolutely awesome shine afterwards."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "We will also run a little with the Foam Gun. It's the Purify S in the Foam Gun."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "There is a neat video for that. I'll link it below so you can see how to mix."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "I think it's quite nice to foam out the Purify S first so that you get it all over the car."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "You do this out of opportunity, of course."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Then we run a bit in the bucket as usual and fluff it up."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Then Jomte and I will drive with wash gloves."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Of course, it works well with a sponge or if you use microfiber cloths."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "But just think about drawing straight lines which I always nag about."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "So that you minimize the risk if something gets in."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "We will foam this out and then shampoo the whole car."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "So we drive on."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "It's great to get a good lubricating surface."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Now it is important that you start from the top down."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Now there are several of us who do this."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "But start from the top down. Straight lines so you don't get these washing suns."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "When the sun hits the paint when it's dry, it's much nicer."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "If you have drawn straight lines, there is less risk of seeing such things."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And as I said, start from the top and work your way down."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "You know I've talked about it in several videos when I show how to wash otherwise."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "I never go further than down to this edge which is usually the case."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "If you have a car that doesn't have a slightly more modern edge, you have to be a little sensitive."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "But pull down to the edge and then you take the last turn."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Then you also know that I usually talk about the two-bucket method."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "It is also just like everything else before."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Is this a Ferrari or something else?"}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Or like your little dream car?"}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Then the two-bucket method runs."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "It is always nice to minimize the risk and have some problems."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "But since we know the basic condition of this one, it is a bucket that will do just fine."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Because we have thoroughly tested it before."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And I think most of you out there will drive a bucket anyway."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "But yes, Purify S."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Now we shampoo the whole car and then it's not that much more that we have to rinse it off."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And so the next step is to dry the car."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And while Mangan and Jomte are shampooing the car, I'll take care of the rims."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "After all, we've already done rough work and it's usually enough like this."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "But I like to... Of course, you have to separate the bucket for your rim stuff."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "It must absolutely be its own bucket."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "But I usually only use ordinary microfiber cloths."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Then you can drive a cheap variant. It doesn't have to be anything special."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "But I run our usual standard canvas."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "So I think it's shit nice to really be able to access and get into the back of the rim."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Where it is difficult to access with brushes and things like this."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "So, like driving with a microfibre cloth usually works really well."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "It's gentle, it's easy to access."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And yes, it's not that much harder than that."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "So I drive all the rims and then they get to keep shampooing."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And then we just have to rinse them off."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And then you know with the water that is left in the bucket."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "There are damn expensive drops in here."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "I'm a little crazy."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "I usually finish with the water that is left in the regular shampoo bucket."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "I finish that by just kind of throwing a little light on the rims."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "It's usually enough, there's usually a little bit left."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And that's enough, as are all four rims."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Probably makes no difference, but it feels nice."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And man, no drops go to waste."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Then we have reached the point where it is actually time to start drying the car."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "But you know that we have Refracten, which is absolutely amazing as a wet coat."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And I know there are a lot of you out there who may not really have a clue what wet coat is."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "We've done some films and stuff like this."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "We have here, this is our Refracten ceramic quick coat, I call it."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "It works equally well on a wet or dry car."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "We have a variant that is with an apology."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And you know that it will work out."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "So it is only important that you shake it beforehand."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "So this one is one in ten."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And then we also have it in its pure form as well."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "So we thought we'd show the car here now, how it works and how damn nice it is."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Because as you can see, there is basically zero runoff here."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "So either way, I'll show both with the excused one and the regular one."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And you won't notice a huge difference."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Drive when it's clean and it will last better."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And productivity, that's a big difference."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Drive when it's clean and it will last better."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And the product is absolutely best applied to a completely dry car."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "But, we shower a little."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "We can start with the one who is one in ten then."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Just shake it well before."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And then just start showering."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Then you don't have to take such absolutely magnificent amounts."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "But make sure that you really cover the surfaces that are to be showered off as well."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "We'll make sure we don't miss anything here."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And as I said, this is diluted one in ten."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "We just shower."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And then you start from the top down."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Yes, as you can see, there will be a lot of runoff all at once."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "It is important, however, that you have to dry the car afterwards."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Because there is a risk that it could become a little bit flamboyant if it just dries in like this."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "So if you just wipe the car afterwards, it will be amazing."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And as I said, that was one in ten."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Now we will drive down the concentrate rest of the part up here."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And it will last a little better."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "But that's quite a lot of product waste."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Because it takes quite a lot."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "So always start by diluting it."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And then also, if you have high blood pressure."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "A little depending on how high the pressure is."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Try to shoot at an oblique angle all the time."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "With the fact that it is a little jelly-like in shape."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "So it will be easier to get it off instead of just shooting straight."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "But here we run it completely in pure format."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "This is like a black car."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "So this is quite difficult to achieve with many products."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "But because the refract is so damn easy to use."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "So, yes."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "So."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And here you can see this quite clearly."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "As I nag about it becoming a bit jellyish."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Here we have washed it off."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And here it remains."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And as you see."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "It will be like a slightly soapy film."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "So it is therefore important that you rinse it off properly."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And then you dry."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Then there won't be any problems."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "But let yourselves when this."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Do you see the batter?"}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Dry in the sun."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Of course, then it gets a little flamboyant."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "But just make sure you rinse it off properly."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "So it will be all thumbs up."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "So."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Then we have run the refract as a wet coat this time."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And it's probably a little, so most people use it."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "But again."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "I think it's cruelest on a dry car."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Here it was a little because we wanted to show."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "A black car is damn nice to see the difference too."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Now it's time to wipe the car."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And here I am with the Apex Plus."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And you know that I'm always nagging about."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "I think it's great to use as a drying support."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Now maybe it will be a little cake on top of the cake."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Actually when you have run the refract as a wet coat."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "But still a little nice to just draw some shower in the canvas."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Because then you kind of help."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "If it should be the case that there is a slightly thicker layer of refract left."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Or something like that."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "You get a little lubricating surface."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And yes, it's just a matter of starting to dry."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Don't forget that you should otherwise always run Apex Plus as a drying aid."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "It helps the surface become much crisper and fresher."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "So yeah, it's not much more than that."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "We dry the car and then we are almost done on the outside."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Then we are done with all the chemicals on the outside."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And the result is at least 100% nicer."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "But then the car is super scratchy."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "You can't do anything about that."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "We have to polish that off, of course."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Now it's more for us to show all the products and such."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "But now all the little details remain."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "We'll keep at it and fix a bit with the windows."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "We will do the plastic stuff on the outside."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "A little tire lance and all that."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "So now we back it in to us."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Then it's time for the squares."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "In the meantime, Mangan and Jonte will start cleaning out the car."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "We start by taking it off because we can see that it is littered."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Make sure it is sufficiently chilled."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Then we can hold on and take it off."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "That's the last thing I have taxes on."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And so it's not that long before you've taken the car off"}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "to make sure it's completely frozen."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "And then I get to take it off."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "It is crunchy that you feel that it is so unused."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "It's like you shouldn't do business with it."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "It is much more disruptive."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "It's time for the windows and in the meantime manga and jonte will start cleaning the car, start vacuuming and something like that."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Here I stand with two different cloths. I run regular Vision then, the one without drainage."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "There is, of course, Vision Plus, which also has a slightly easier drainage."}
{"prompt": "Respond in this tone:", "completion": "Two different cloths, the glass cloth that penetrates a little more deeply and then I will dry with the all-round cloth."}
